DVBAPI plugin for VDR

  The plugin allows connect VDR to OScam. It creates a software CAM in VDR,
and communicates with OSCam over camd.socket (using 'dvbapi' module).
This way it pass decryption requests to OSCam and obtains back keys which
are needed for CSA stream decryption. Decryption of the stream is done using
DeCSA libraries (FFdecsa or libdvbcsa).

2. Getting the source code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will have to grab the source code of course. First install the git
package provided by your distribution. Then from a terminal, type:

   $ cd /usr/local/src/vdr/PLUGINS/src
   $ git clone git://github.com/manio/vdr-plugin-dvbapi.git
   $ ln -s vdr-plugin-dvbapi dvbapi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Basic Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For sample installation instructions refer to INSTALL file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. VDR and OScam compatibility
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current versions of this plugin uses a new VDR CAM decrypt interface, which
was added in VDR 2.1.3. Additional fixes was added in VDR 2.1.4,
and I recommend this version as minimal VDR version for recent plugin
versions (2.0.0 or newer). You also need OScam svn rev >= 9095.

*** NOTE FOR VDR VERSION < 2.1.4
    If you are using VDR older then 2.1.4 then you also need an older plugin
    version, 1.0.6 is the last that will work.
    You also need OScam svn rev >= 7314 in this case.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Plugin setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The log level parameter of the plugin can be configured either from VDR
menu or manually editing the VDR's setup.conf file (remember to change
the file when VDR is not running).

The parameter line for the plugin is:
dvbapi.LogLevel = 2

The values for the log level are:
  0 - totally disable debug
  1 - only error messages
  2 - information and error messages (default)
  3 - all information including debug
