2014-01-27 Version 2.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This version is a big step towards simplifying plugin architecture.
Changes since version 1.0.6:

OSCam changes allows:
- Use one single socket connection to camd.socket for all channels
  and all adapters.
- Keys are also sent using same camd.socket, UDP is not used
  anymore.

Using new VDR CAM interface gave the following benefits:
- Plugin doesn't need to create VDR devices, and loading subplugins
  for hardware devices.
- The plugin doesn't need to create own TS buffer for DeCSA
  decryption, it's now done on VDR side.
- Opening demux for obtaining PMT data has been dropped
  (refer to the FAQ).
