Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package. 

 Run`configure --help' for more details.

Using:
 1) Start the softcam with LD_PRELOAD:
 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/dvbapi_ca.so /usr/local/bin/oscam -b
 
 2) Start the VDR with dvbpi plugin
 /usr/local/bin/vdr -c /etc/vdr -E /var/vdr -L /usr/local/lib/vdr -P dvbapi 

 3) In the oscam.conf file add following options
	[dvbapi]
	enabled = 1
	au = 1
	boxtype = pc    
	user = vdr
	pmt_mode = 1
	request_mode = 1

   boxtype to "pc" will allow oscam to take adapter/demux information from CAPMT frame.
   pmt_mode to "1" will allow oscam to use camd.socket in /tmp/ dir

 4) Apply patch in patches directory to oscam source code
    
	$ cd oscam
        $ patch -p1 < /usr/local/src/vdr/PLUGINS/src/dvbapi/patches/oscam-trunk-vdr.diff
